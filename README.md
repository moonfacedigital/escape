# Escape
Help domestic abuse victims discreetly escape support websites âœŠðŸ‘£

### How it works
#### 1. Masking
Escape displays a Google look-alike as it readies for redirection.

Both the icon and Title in the toolbar also change to represent Google

#### 2. Erasure

- The previous site it erased from the browsers history
- Pressing the back button will not take you back

#### 3. Redirection

- The browser is securely redirected to Google.com
- Thanks to the Google look-alike, this process is unrecognisable.
